# Logic-Gates-Simulator-2019
This is a group project created in Software Project class at PLNU.
It is an interface where a user can build and test a circuit board design using AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, INPUT and OUTPUT gates.
There is a mode for creating and a mode for testing. In the creating mode, you can add or remove gates 
and connect them with wires. In the testing mode, you can toggle inputs of 0 or 1 and see how they affect the different
outputs based on how the signal travels through the wires and gates. You can also upload a certain format file in order 
to automatically build a circuit, and you can save a circuit that you have built back into a file.
